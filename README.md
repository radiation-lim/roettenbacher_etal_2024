# Repository for publication RÃ¶ttenbacher et al. 2024

Corresponding repository to the paper handed in to ACP.
Here you can find a sample input file for ecRad and a Fortran namelist for the reference simulation.

Furthermore, the python script used to create the figures and to do the statistical analysis can also be found here.
If you want to run this script, you need to install the [LIM-pylim python package](https://github.com/radiation-lim/LIM-pylim) and configure the config.toml file to match your file paths.
